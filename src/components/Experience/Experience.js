    I worked on the Amazon Payment Experience (APX) team, where I migrated the Refunds page
    widget from a legacy framework to a modern, scalable system. This enhanced user experience
    by enabling seamless management of bank account details and refunds for thousands of users.
    I implemented secure refund processing for high-value transactions, reducing security risks by
    30% through encryption and audit trails. Additionally, I developed a new client interface that
    allowed client-specific widget configurations, optimizing performance by rendering only required
    components.
